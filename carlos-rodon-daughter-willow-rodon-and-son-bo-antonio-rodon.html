On Mother’s Day in May 2020, the American baseball player shared a lovely photo of Ashely and Willow.</p><p>Similarly, Rodon shared a video of himself with his two pillars of life, his wife Ashely and his 2-year-old daughter Willow. “My princess, happy 2nd birthday.

C. Roberson High School in the North Carolina 4A state championship.</p><p>By the end of the year, Carlos had already been scouted by the Milwaukee Brewers in the 16th round of the 2011 Major League Baseball Draft.</p><p>Rodon, however, declined the offer and continued his studies at North Carolina State University.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Career_Of_Carlos_Rodon></span>Career Of Carlos Rodon<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Rodon made his MLB debut in 2015 for the Chicago White Sox, and he has spent much of his career dealing with injuries.</p><p>The White Sox did not tender him in December 2020, but he re-signed on a one-year contract the following month.</p><p>He went on to have a spectacular season, earning All-Star honours for the first time in his career with a 2.37 ERA and 185 strikeouts in 24 starts.</p><p>Rodon also threw the White Sox’s 20th no-hitter in a game against the Cleveland Guardians in April of last year.</p><p>In response, the San Francisco Giants signed him in a big-money deal for the current season, and he is repaying their faith by consistently putting in extremely high-quality performances.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Carlos_Rodon_MLB_Career></span>Carlos Rodon MLB Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Rodon was selected in the 2014 MLB draught by the Chicago White Sox. He spent his first year in the minor leagues before being called up to the Red Sox’s MLB squad later that year. He made his MLB debut against Cleveland and also struck out for the first time. At 22 years old, he became the fourth Red Sox rookie to record 10 or more strikeouts twice in a season.</p><p>Rodon began the 2016 season with a loss. He came back stronger, however, and helped the team to a five-game winning streak, a career high. The next four years were difficult for the 28-year-old.</p><p>Rodon has been plagued by wrist and biceps injuries that have kept him out of the game for longer than he has been on it. Rodon had Ulnar collateral ligament reconstruction surgery in 2019, which kept him out for the entire year.</p><p>Previously, he had only made seven appearances for the Chicago White Sox. His return to action in the 2020 season came midway through the season, and he only made four appearances. He signed a one-year contract extension with the White Sox in 2021.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Career_Stats></span>Career Stats<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><table class="vk_tbl Uekwlc" style=width:82.5037%;height:667px><tbody><tr><th class="Z3XQ4e Gt0LNd">Year</th><th class="Z3XQ4e Gt0LNd">Team</th><th class="Z3XQ4e Gt0LNd r4NXy" title="Games played">GP</th><th class="Z3XQ4e Gt0LNd r4NXy" title="At bats">AB</th><th class="Z3XQ4e Gt0LNd r4NXy" title=Runs>R</th><th class="Z3XQ4e Gt0LNd r4NXy" title=Hits>H</th><th class="Z3XQ4e Gt0LNd r4NXy" title="Runs batted in">RBI</th><th class="Z3XQ4e Gt0LNd r4NXy" title=Walks>BB</th><th class="Z3XQ4e Gt0LNd r4NXy" title=Strikeouts>SO</th><th class="Z3XQ4e Gt0LNd r4NXy" title="Home runs">HR</th><th class="Z3XQ4e Gt0LNd r4NXy" title="Batting average">Avg</th></tr><tr aria-hidden=true><td colspan=11></td></tr><tr><td class="Z3XQ4e zdF0Cc">2021</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">White Sox</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">24</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">3</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">0</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">0</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">0</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">0</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">1</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">0</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">.000</td></tr><tr aria-hidden=true><td colspan=11></td></tr><tr><td class="Z3XQ4e zdF0Cc">2020</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">White Sox</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">–</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">–</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">–</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">–</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">–</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">–</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">–</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">–</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">–</td></tr><tr aria-hidden=true><td colspan=11></td></tr><tr><td class="Z3XQ4e zdF0Cc">2019</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">White Sox</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">–</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">–</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">–</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">–</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">–</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">–</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">–</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">–</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">–</td></tr><tr aria-hidden=true><td colspan=11></td></tr><tr><td class="Z3XQ4e zdF0Cc">2018</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">White Sox</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">–</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">–</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">–</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">–</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">–</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">–</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">–</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">–</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">–</td></tr><tr aria-hidden=true><td colspan=11></td></tr><tr><td class="Z3XQ4e zdF0Cc">2017</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">White Sox</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">12</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">6</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">0</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">2</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">2</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">0</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">2</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">0</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">.333</td></tr><tr aria-hidden=true><td colspan=11></td></tr><tr><td class="Z3XQ4e zdF0Cc">2016</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">White Sox</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">28</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">3</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">0</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">0</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">0</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">0</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">2</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">0</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">.000</td></tr><tr aria-hidden=true><td colspan=11></td></tr><tr><td class="Z3XQ4e zdF0Cc">2015</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">White Sox</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">26</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">1</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">0</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">0</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">0</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">0</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">1</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">0</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">.000</td></tr><tr aria-hidden=true><td colspan=11></td></tr><tr><td class="Z3XQ4e zdF0Cc">Career</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">121</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">13</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">0</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">2</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">2</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">0</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">6</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">0</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">.154</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=International_Career_Of_Carlos_Rodon></span>International Career Of Carlos Rodon<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Rodon has yet to appear in many international games.
