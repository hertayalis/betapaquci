Gavin was introduced to his older siblings Flynn, Logan, Shea, and Lia after being welcomed into a new family.</p><p>But he wasn’t the only one who was introduced to a new family. It appears that the family had an interest in acting. They relocated from Atlanta to Los Angeles in 2015 to pursue acting opportunities for Gavin’s older siblings. Gavin’s interest in acting was born as a result. He was reportedly just starting kindergarten at the time and used to accompany his brother and sister to their auditions.</p><p>Gavin soon asked his parents for his own audition, and to everyone’s surprise, opportunities poured in. Furthermore, some of his works required his family to appear in the video, which undoubtedly aided his sibling’s promotion.</p><p>Gavin’s sister Lia McHugh was already on her way to stardom. She has appeared in films such as Eternals (2021), Songbird (2020), The Lodge (2019), and the television series American Woman (2018).</p><h2><span id=Is_Gavin_McHugh_affected_by_Cerebral_Palsy>Is Gavin McHugh affected by Cerebral Palsy?</span></h2><p>Yes, Gavin McHugh has Cerebral Palsy in real life, just like his character “Christopher” in 9-1-1. According to reports, actors without disabilities play more than 95 percent of characters with disabilities on television, but 9-1-1 defied that trend by casting Gavin and ensuring his full inclusion.</p><p>A cerebral palsy is a group of disorders that affect a person’s ability to move and maintain balance and posture, according to ccd.gov.</p><h2><span id=Childhood_Education_Hometown>Childhood, Education, Hometown</span></h2><p>Latvia, a European country, is Gavin McHugh’s birthplace. Following his adoption, he relocated to the United States.</p><p>Gavin has had Cerebral Palsy since he was a child, and it has been a lifelong struggle for him. He didn’t, however, let his gift prevent him from living a normal life. He went to a regular school, just like any other kid. Furthermore, his classmates adored him!</p><p>Gavin’s favorite pastime was reading. Gavin’s parents revealed that he has a fantastic memory and remembers almost everything.</p><p>In the winter of 2020, Gavin received a citizenship award from Walk Disney Elementary School.</p><h2><span id=Social_Media_Instagram_Facebook_and_Twitter><span class="TextRun SCXW251784489 BCX8" lang=en-us xml:lang=EN-US data-contrast=auto><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW251784489 BCX8" data-ccp-parastyle="heading 2">Social Media: Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter</span></span><span class="EOP SCXW251784489 BCX8" data-ccp-props='{"201341983":0,"335559738":40,"335559739":0,"335559740":259}'>&nbsp;</span></span></h2><p>Gavin had 68.5K Instagram followers by March 2021.
