It should be noted that the majority of quartzites that etch are mislabeled. Quartzite, in its natural state, is very durable. Even while etching is more obvious on light/white coloured stone, the dulling look of etching will be seen on any hue quartzite.
People have also inquired as to whether quartzite can be leathered. Compared to polished quartzite, polished quartzite does not display etching as quickly; nevertheless, the honing process widens the pores, making the stone more prone to discoloration.</description></item><item><title>Julianne Hough breaks her silence on ex Ryan Seacrest and why they ended their relationship</title><link>/julianne-hough-breaks-her-silence-on-ex-ryan-seacrest-and-why-they-ended-their-relationship.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/julianne-hough-breaks-her-silence-on-ex-ryan-seacrest-and-why-they-ended-their-relationship.html</guid><description>Julianne Hough&amp;nbsp;recently opened up about her past relationship with media personality Ryan Seacrest, sharing how he changed her perspective away from her strict Morman beliefs.&amp;nbsp;

元メンバーの多くは現在も歌手活動を続けたり、政治家になったりと表舞台で活躍されています。
HITOEさんだけが唯一、メディアにも出演せず普通の暮らしをしています。
2013年に結婚して以来、子供が産まれたのか、現在も旦那さんと離婚せずに仲良くしているのかなど不明です。
今日は、SPEEDに在籍していた時代のHITOEさんについて、そして結婚相手との馴れ初めとその後の噂について書いてみたいと思います。
SPEEDのHITOE（本名：新垣仁絵）ってどんな人？レゲエ文化を愛する個性派
芸名 HITOE（ひとえ） 本名 新垣仁絵（あらがき ひとえ） 出身地 沖縄県島尻郡八重瀬町 生年月日 1981年4月7日 身長 154センチ 元SPEEDのHITOEさんは沖縄県出身で、現在は芸能界を引退されています。
初期から中心メンバーとして活躍し、バラエディでも存在感を示していました。
SPEEDメンバーの多くが現在も表舞台で活動していますが、HITOEさんは美術系の専門学校に留学し、唯一一般的な仕事をされている方です。
2011年に再結成した際にはHITOEさんも招集されましたが、2013年に一般人男性と結婚されたということで、今後は表舞台に出ない可能性が高いです。
HITOEはブラックミュージックを愛する超個性派だった SPEEDといえば、典型的なキャッチなJ-popユニットでした。
メンバーも当時の日本人のトレンドである髪型やファッションを取り入れており、HITOEさんもデビュー当時は普通の女の子のような格好をしていました。
しかし、ある時期からHITOEさんだけは超個性派の出立をするようになりました。
HITOEさんはSPEEDで活動していたい時代からトレッドやコンローのようなブラックミュージック系のファッションを好みました。
理由は簡単で、HITOEさん本人が黒人の音楽を愛していたせいです。
特にジャマイカの国民的音楽・レゲエが大好きで、その影響を強く受けていました。
一時期は肌を黒く焼いていたこともあったほどです。
HITOEが結婚した相手は黒人ではなく日本人。馴れ初めはNY！現在までにヨガ教室を開く HITOEさんは2013年に一般人の男性と結婚しました。
結婚のニュースが流れた後に、
”もしかして結婚相手って黒人じゃない？”
との噂が流れていました。
しかし、実際には日本人男性であります。
純愛貫き、ゴールイン！女性４人組ボーカルダンスグループ、ＳＰＥＥＤのＨＩＴＯＥこと新垣仁絵（３２）が大安の８日、ブログで３４歳の日本人男性と結婚したことを報告した。
年齢は相手の方が2歳年上だそうです。
HITOEさんと現在の旦那の馴れ初めはドラマのように素敵で、留学中のNYで、HITOEさんがカフェで待ち合わせていた知人男性と間違えて、現在の旦那さんに声をかけてしまったことが出会いのきっかけなのです。
旦那の職業はNYでクリエイティブな仕事をしているとの噂がありますが、当時はHITOEさんも留学中だったということで、現在は日本で別の仕事をしてる可能性が高いです。
結婚後に芸能界引退。絵やヨガインスタトラクターの仕事 HITOEさんは2013年に結婚した後に芸能界を引退しています。
厳密にはずっと前から芸能活動は行っていませんでしたが、事務所自体にはずっと所属しており、その事務所自体を退社したということです。
報道によると、新垣は昨年4月、米・ニューヨークで出会った一般人男性と結婚。結婚をきっかけに、タレント活動をしたくない旨を所属事務所に伝えていたという。新垣は給料制だったため、それまでは仕事をしなくても給料は支払われていましたが、その後のタレント契約の更新せず。現在、所属事務所のホームページにSPEEDのページはあるが、新垣の個人のプロフィールは掲載されていないというのだ。
SPEED解散後は絵画関連の仕事や、ヨガインストラクターなど、悠々自適に暮らしていましたが、それは所属事務所であったライジングプロダクションが彼女を功労者として手厚い月給を払っていたからだとされています。
解散後はヨガのインストラクターを職にする傍ら、ヨガ教室まで開いていたそうです。
2008年に一時的に再結成した後は、少しだけ芸能の仕事もされていましたが、その後に再び表舞台から消えたのです。
また、既婚者になってからは仕事や近況の詳細不明となっています。
新垣仁絵（HITOE）に癌疑惑？結婚発表当時は子供もいない 急にHITOEさんの近況の情報が途絶えたということで、”現在は子供を産んで専業主婦をしているのでは？”という憶測が多くあります。
結婚発表当時から、HITOEさんと旦那さんの間に子供がいるという情報はありません。
もしかしたら、噂通りに2013年以降に子供を産んで、現在は平和は普通の暮らしをしているのかもしれません。
ちなみに、HITOEさんが表舞台に登場しないのは”癌など重たい病気を患っている”という憶測もあります。
現在の新垣仁絵（HITOE）が癌を患っている可能性は低い？ 長く表舞台に登場していないHITOEさん。
一部では重たい病気にかかって、闘病生活をしてるとような噂もあります。</description></item><item><title>What kind of caulk do you use in a shower?</title><link>/what-kind-of-caulk-do-you-use-in-a-shower.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/what-kind-of-caulk-do-you-use-in-a-shower.html</guid><description>The best caulk to use in a shower is 100-percent silicone caulk designed for plumbing applications, often sold as tub-and-tile or kitchen-and-bath caulk.
