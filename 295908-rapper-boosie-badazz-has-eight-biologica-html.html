While many people are familiar with his music, some might be surprised to know about Boosie's children and how he has fathered eight kids.</p><p class=dh>Born Torrence Ivy Hatch Jr, Boosie became famous after being part of the 1990s hip-hop group Concentration Camp. He went on to pursue a successful solo career and was 19 years old when he welcomed his first child.</p><p class=dh>The rapper said he had one or two regrets about fatherhood, but that did not stop him from being a doting dad. From lavish gifts to musical collaborations, Boosie shows that he is very much in his children's lives. Alongside treating them with gifts, the rapper spoke about providing his children with a better childhood than the one he had.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Meet All 8 Kids</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Boosie's eight children are Ivy Ray Hatch, Lyric Beyonce Hatch, Toriana Hatch, Iviona Hatch, Michael Jordan Hatch, Tarlaysia Hatch, Torrance Hatch Jr, and Laira Jean.</p><p class=dh>Boosie has eight kids with six different women, and in a 2018 interview with The Box, Boosie <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.the-sun.com/entertainment/4924039/boosie-badazz-children/>spoke </a>candidly about having multiple children with different women:</p><p class=dh>"I'd keep my same kids, just fewer baby mothers."</p><p class=dh>The rapper was young when he began having children and <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.the-sun.com/entertainment/4924039/boosie-badazz-children/>said</a>, "watch out for that." Had he been able to make a choice again, he said he would have had his children with the same women. Despite this, Boosie is a committed father and <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.the-sun.com/entertainment/4924039/boosie-badazz-children/>said </a>it was his job to "motivate" his children.</p><p class=dh>He encouraged them to chase their dreams but also stressed the importance of education. "School is very important to my household," Boosie <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.the-sun.com/entertainment/4924039/boosie-badazz-children/>said </a>and revealed that he grew up in a home where his mother taught him the importance of school.</p><p class=dh>The rapper <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.the-sun.com/entertainment/4924039/boosie-badazz-children/>said </a>he tried to motivate his kids and "keep (them) wanting more."

His children appear on his social media, and although the page is said to be fan-ran, Boosie's children have an Instagram account dedicated to them.</p><p class=dh>However, the last post was on August 12, 2017. His children have ensured Boosie<a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.distractify.com/p/boosie-badazz-children> isn't the only rapper in the family</a> and pursued rap careers. His kids Iviona and Torrance are aspiring rappers with an increasing fan base.</p><p class=dh>According to Dicy Trends, one of his other daughters, Toriana, pursued a music career but chose to become a singer instead of a rapper. Lyric inherited the musical gene but is also an athlete and enjoys soccer. Little is known about the personal lives of Boosie's other children.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>One of His Daughters</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Iviona was born on December 4, 2001, in Louisiana.

Her father was 19 years old when he had her with Walnita Decuir and has gone above and beyond for his daughter's birthday in the past.</p><p class=dh>On her 16th birthday, Boosie gifted Iviona with a Porsche Panamera, which has a reported worth of $100K. When she turned 20, Iviona received multiple pairs of shoes and $100K in cash.</p><p class=dh>She performs under Poison Ivi after changing it from Iviona Badazz and goes by different names, including the Princess of the South. She's been rapping since she was ten years old, and her first single was released over ten years ago.</p><p class=dh>The track was titled "Daughter of a King and Queen," Iviona reportedly made the song to raise funds for her father's legal battles. In October 2018, Iviona released a song titled "Go off" that featured her father.</p><p class=dh>Since its release, the music video has garnered over 2 million views and 43 thousand likes at the time of publication.

During a 2017 interview with Vlad TV, Boosie <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://heavy.com/entertainment/2020/05/boosie-badazz-son-daughter-mothers/>said </a>he did not "believe in" having to split assets with his former spouse after getting divorced and did not see himself getting married. He <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://heavy.com/entertainment/2020/05/boosie-badazz-son-daughter-mothers/>said</a>:</p><p class=dh>"I'm not finna marry a woman, and I cheat on her, and I got to split millions of dollars with her. Hell no! [sic]"</p><p class=dh>In March 2014, TMZ reported that Decuir, Taylor, Weatherspoon, and Haze were planning to air a reality TV that documented their lives and the ups and downs that came with it. Boosie said he wasn't initially fond of the idea, as he was trying to avoid any potential conflict between the children and their mothers.</p><p class=dh>But the rapper <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://heavy.com/entertainment/2020/05/boosie-badazz-son-daughter-mothers/>said </a>that if they "want to get money," he would not stand in their way. He had no plans of appearing on the show but would support their decision. Decuir, the mother of Boosie's first child, has a Facebook page and an Instagram account.</p><p class=dh>In 2014, she released a novel, "When the Music Stops," and although she did not mention any names, she spoke about an ex-boyfriend who was a rapper and cheated on her.</p><p class=dh>Decuir does not interact on social media often, whereas <a class="me a" href=#>Boosie </a>tweeted about having his Instagram account suspended.
