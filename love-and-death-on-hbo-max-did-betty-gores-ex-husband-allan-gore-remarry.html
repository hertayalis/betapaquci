Actor <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jesse Plemons</a> plays the character of Allan Gore in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HBO Max</a> limited series titled <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">'Love and Death'</a>. He was described as a shy person who came across as stern or aloof.</p><p>Allan Gore, who was in St Paul, Minnesota, on business at the time of the crime in Wylie, Texas, couldn't reach his wife Betty Gore and had asked neighbors to check on her, who discovered her dead. Goreâ€™s affair with Candy Montgomery led to his wife being murdered with an axe and was reportedly struck 41 times. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elizabeth Olsen</a> stars as Candy Montgomery while Lily Rabe plays Betty Gore on the show.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>'Love & Death' on HBO Max: The real-life story behind David E Kelly's latest show starring Elizabeth Olsen</a></p><p><a href=# rel>HBO Max's 'Love & Death' trailer previews housewife's mundane life, an affair and a gruesome murder</a></p><h2 class=split>Did Allan Gore remarry?</h2><p>Allan, a teacher's aide at a college in Kansas, met Betty when she went to college, and they later moved to Texas. From the outside, their marriage appeared to be normal, but it was later revealed that it was riddled with infidelity and boredom, which is how Allan's 10-month affair with Candy began. During questioning, Allan Gore did admit to the police about his extramarital affairs with Candy Montgomery, offering the authorities with intent and ultimately leading to Candy's arrest, yet she was found not guilty after an eight-day trial.</p><p>Less than three months after Candy Montgomery's acquittal, Allan Gore married the former Elaine Clift, and the family later relocated to Sachse, northeast of Garland. The sisters had a difficult time in the initial few years of their dad's second marriage. The elder daughter disclosed that she was in and out of therapy as a pre-teen and that Allan and Elaine would often use food withholding as punishment. Elaine and Allan Gore filed for divorce, and Gore lost the custody of his daughters; Alisa and Bethany, which eventually led to their grandparents Bertha and Bob Pomeroy, raising the sisters.</p><h2 class=split>Where is the Gore family now?</h2><p>Allan Gore is currently retired and resides in Sarasota, Florida, according to his Facebook page. Since 2016, he has been in a domestic partnership. According to the social media website, Gore makes it appear to be no longer alienated from his daughters since they're all friends on the platform and have publicly communicated. Elaine Clift is now a college music instructor in the northeastern United States. According to their social media profiles, Alisa works for a multinational conglomerate corporation and Bethany is a teacher. The Gores have more or less avoided the spotlight and have never remarked on the stories about their family.</p><p>Back in 2000, Bethany told <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">The Dallas Morning News</a> "I'm curious if she thinks about it every day, as I do. I'm curious if she thinks about us. I only wish I knew what happened," The younger daughter added, "because no one knows except her. What irritates me is imagining what could have been." Lisa revealed that her mother was 30 years old when she was killed, and the closer she gets to that age she remembers how young her mother was when she was brutally murdered.&nbsp;</p><p>'Love and Death' premiered on HBO Max on April 27.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRopJ%2Brsm6tzZ1knZ2RqbVuu81mn5unXaKuuXnDoptmmpWpwbp5xqipnqtdmsVutNSsmZqmlGKurbjAp2Sgp6KaerOxzJqpq7E%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flove-and-death-on-hbo-max-did-betty-gores-ex-husband-allan-gore-remarry.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2flove-and-death-on-hbo-max-did-betty-gores-ex-husband-allan-gore-remarry.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2flove-and-death-on-hbo-max-did-betty-gores-ex-husband-allan-gore-remarry.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2flove-and-death-on-hbo-max-did-betty-gores-ex-husband-allan-gore-remarry.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flove-and-death-on-hbo-max-did-betty-gores-ex-husband-allan-gore-remarry.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2flove-and-death-on-hbo-max-did-betty-gores-ex-husband-allan-gore-remarry.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./are-there-worms-in-pistachios.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./are-there-worms-in-pistachios.html>Are there worms in pistachios?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./what-does-nimble-storage-do.html>What does Nimble Storage do?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./what-does-nimble-storage-do.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
