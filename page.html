Personally, I’d love to eat tacos for any holiday feast, but would you?&nbsp;Raise your hand if so – I’m taking notes for next year… Delicata squash is one of my favorite squashes for a few reasons: 1. you can cut it without worrying about cutting your arm off, and 2. you can roast it with the skins on – no peeling necessary – and it’s so sweet and tender.

So when opportunities like this come my way, I’m all in!&nbsp;Last month, I spent an amazing few days&nbsp;with Williams Sonoma,&nbsp;Fortessa,&nbsp;The Fairmont, and a group of lovely bloggers in&nbsp;Sonoma.&nbsp;We were wined and dined and wined some more… Here’s just a quick recap! I’m a sucker for&nbsp;kitchen gear so it was fun to&nbsp;visit the original Williams Sonoma store. It just reopened this year – many of the charming details were replicated from the store that Chuck Williams first opened in 1956.

In lieu of any ricotta, Parmesan, or mozzarella cheese, I stuff them with a light, dairy-free “ricotta.” Made from cashew cream, crumbled tofu,&nbsp;herbs, and lemon zest, it’s rich and flavorful. If&nbsp;your family is squeamish about tofu, just don’t tell them. They’ll never suspect it here.

During the first years that&nbsp;Jack and I were together, we traveled to visit family&nbsp;for every single&nbsp;holiday. It took us a while to&nbsp;realize that Thanksgiving weekend air travel is the worst of them all. So now we have a tradition of staying home with no real tradition. One year we stayed in and made&nbsp;risotto. The year after that we had a friends-giving (before they were called that). Last year, we stayed home and worked (we were just beginning the book). This year we’re going to gather with friends over a fun & easygoing…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Currently, I’m sitting inside with three shirts on, one scarf, and one coat. I’ve been in Chicago for the last few days visiting my family, and it’s no surprise that I showed up just in time for the first snow. It always knows when I’m coming. In my parents’ house, there are 3 options to get warm&nbsp;– first, don’t take your coat off, and second, turn up the heat when no one is looking… but by far the most effective method is to BAKE.

Whether you’re a Thanksgiving traditionalist, an all side-dish-eater, or you have a family member that just turned vegetarian, here are a few of my favorite healthier holiday recipes that will hopefully spark a bit of inspiration.

It’s so easy to toss together: marinate thinly shaved fennel and radishes for a few minutes before tossing them with arugula, toasted walnuts, and creamy avocado. And if you have it on hand, a dollop of pesto really takes it to the next level. With a simple lemon dressing, this salad has the perfect balance of creamy, crunchy, bright, and bitter components. It’s an excellent choice for a weeknight, but it’s good enough to serve as a side salad for a special occasion.

It’s my go-to meal when I’m not working on new recipes, when I’m tired after a long day, and when I’ve definitely had too much take-out pho for one week. It’s not a 30-minute meal because roasting a sweet potato takes at least that long, but the rest is so darn simple. Plus, nothing actually calms me more than the wafting aroma of sweet potatoes roasting in my kitchen. There’s no fancy sauce in this recipe.

I don’t care if they’re trendy or not, the good fat that you get from avocados always makes for a delicious, nutrient-dense meal or mid-day snack. In an effort not to show you yet another version of avocado toast – I have the next best thing – the avocado tostada. It’s like avocado toast in disguise.
