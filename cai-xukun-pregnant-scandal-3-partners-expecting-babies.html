style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Cai Xukun pregnant scandal stems from allegations that some years ago, he had a one-night encounter with a woman who became pregnant.</p><p>It goes without saying that one must be careful what they do as things from the past can very easily come back to haunt anyone.</p><p>The unproven allegation is that Cai Xukun demanded that the woman have an abortion, which she eventually did.</p><p>The controversy received a lot of attention on Weibo, where the hashtag “Cai Xukun Ms. C Abortion” amassed billions of reads and sparked a lot of debates.</p><p>When the woman, named only as Ms. C, chose to reveal the affair two years after the incident, citing emotional harm suffered, the matter took an even more spectacular turn.</p><p>Ms. C revealed alleged proof during a live stream by the paparazzi, including an ultrasound picture of the unborn child, audio recordings of discussions, records of abortions, and WeChat exchanges between Cai Xukun’s mother and staff.</p><p>In the face of the Cai Xukun scandal, media outlet 163 claims that Cai Xukun has in the past had three partners get pregnant.</p><p>He allegedly had a sexual relationship with a pregnant fashion industry worker in 2019.</p><p>He allegedly got acquainted with a female fan who is an SNS influencer later on, which resulted in another pregnancy.</p><p>The most stunning allegation contends that Cai Xukun had a connection with the wealthy family’s teenage daughter, which led to the girl becoming pregnant.</p><p>The rumors also claim that Cai Xukun tried to abduct the last child using a variety of methods, but the wealthy family stopped him.</p><p>Due to the disruption the wealthy family was causing, the situation became so bad that the police had to step in.</p><p>According to reports, Cai Xukun’s mother made peace with the girl’s family and defused the situation, maybe preserving her son’s name and career.</p><ul
