The incident happened at the Academy Awards.</p><p class=dh>While onstage in 2002 to present an Oscar Award for Best Achievement in Makeup, the star and Ryan Phillippe had an unscripted moment. The couple exchanged some hilarious banter before presenting the award.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/bc03c1e3e5d8cbc4958c8d096f465fce.jpeg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Reese Witherspoon at the Sydney "Fear" film premiere in Sydney, Australia on August 1, 1996 | Photo: Patrick Riviere/Getty Images</p><p class=dh>What Witherspoon didn’t expect was that her husband would suddenly go off-script. Their following exchange left the attendees, viewers, and the actress quite surprised and shocked.</p><p class=dh>At the time, Witherspoon was 26, and her husband was 27. As he was about to announce the winner, the actress asked him if she could do it instead and <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.today.com/popculture/reese-witherspoon-flummoxed-ex-ryan-phillippe-s-comment-about-her-t204795>his answer was</a>:</p><p class=dh>"You make more than I do. Go ahead."</p><p class=dh>Speaking to “The HFPA in Conversation” nearly 20 years since the incident, the actress explained how she had felt when Phillippe made the quip. Confessing that she barely remembered the incident, the actress <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/reese-witherspoon/id1342322983?i=1000503483655">recalled</a>:</p><p class=dh>"I was a little bit flummoxed in the moment."</p><p class=dh><a class="me a" href=#>Witherspoon</a>, who is one of the highest-paid actresses, admitted that she’d forgotten about the incident. She explained that her husband hadn’t told her he was going to say that.</p><p class=dh>The Golden Globe-winning star, who is now 44, confessed that she didn’t know why Phillippe said what he said. A few years later, in 2008, the famous couple sadly ended up divorcing after having two children.</p><p class=dh>The former couple shares a daughter Ava, 21, and a son Deacon, 17. During her recent interview, Witherspoon also noted how hard it was for women who make more money than their partners.</p><p class=dh>She noted how these <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/reese-witherspoon/id1342322983?i=1000503483655">women would get shamed</a> for earning more and are expected to give more. Whereas their male counterparts don’t come across such expectations because there are double standards.</p><p class=dh>The “Cruel Intentions” actress recalled when Ava was 8 and <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://edition.cnn.com/2020/12/29/entertainment/reese-witherspoon-ryan-phillippe-oscars-2002-trnd/index.html>came back upset</a> from elementary school. She confessed to her mother that she was teased because Witherspoon earned a lot of money.</p><p class=dh>The “Legally Blonde” star told her that she should never be ashamed of women making lots of money. Besides her two children, the actress also shares a son Tennessee, 8, with her current husband, Jim Toth.</p><p class=dh>In 2017, she appeared on the British talk show “Lorraine” where she opened up about <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.today.com/popculture/reese-witherspoon-marriage-ryan-phillippe-i-would-never-change-anything-t116882>her past marriage</a> to Phillippe. She shared how she’d gotten married when she was 23 and had two children by the time she was 27.</p><p class=dh>Despite this, the “Big Little Lies” actress revealed that she wouldn’t change anything about her past. The star advocated for people to get to know themselves so they don’t regret any of their life choices.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtrcGloZ3qzscSsnGavmam1pr7Sqaaopl2drqV506GgrGWjlsZusddmn66rkpa7b7TTpqM%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f247182-reese-witherspoon-had-this-say-ex-husban-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f247182-reese-witherspoon-had-this-say-ex-husban-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f247182-reese-witherspoon-had-this-say-ex-husban-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f247182-reese-witherspoon-had-this-say-ex-husban-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f247182-reese-witherspoon-had-this-say-ex-husban-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f247182-reese-witherspoon-had-this-say-ex-husban-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./the-meaning-behind-the-song-live-in-it-by-dave-nudo-band.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./the-meaning-behind-the-song-live-in-it-by-dave-nudo-band.html>The Meaning Behind The Song: Live in It by Dave Nudo Band</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./the-amd-x570-motherboard-overview.html>MSI MPG X570 Gaming Pro Carbon WIFI</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./the-amd-x570-motherboard-overview.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
