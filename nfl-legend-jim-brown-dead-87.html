He fought for civil rights, brought athletes from all different sports together to use their platform for good.</p><p>"Many thought Jim retired from football too soon, but he always did it his way.</p><p>"From the football field, to Hollywood, to his work in athlete activism, Jim always played the leading role.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in American Football</h2></p><p>"His devotion to fighting racial injustice, improving education for youth and positively impacting the many lives he has through his Amer-I-Can Program has left a lasting legacy well beyond all he accomplished on the field.</p><p>"Jim Brown is the Cleveland Browns and our thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Monique, his children and entire family as well as all those who mourn this immense loss."</p><p>NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell also released a statement on Friday.</p><p>It read: "On behalf of the entire NFL family, we extend our condolences to Monique and their family.</p><p>"Jim Brown was a gifted athlete -- one of the most dominant players to ever step on any athletic field -- but also a cultural figure who helped promote change.</p><p>â€œDuring his nine-year NFL career, which coincided with the civil rights movement here at home, he became a forerunner and role model for athletes being involved in social initiatives outside their sport.</p><p>"He inspired fellow athletes to make a difference, especially in the communities in which they lived."</p><h2>REMARKABLE CAREER</h2><p>The sixth overall pick in the 1957 NFL Draft out of Syracuse, the six-foot-two, 231 pound running back went on to become a three-time league MVP, an eight-time First-Team All-Pro, and a nine-time Pro Bowler during his nine-year career with the Browns.</p><p>The NFL's leading rusher upon his retirement in 1966, Brown went on to become a star on the silver screen, starring in the likes of The Dirty Dozen, Mars Attacks!, and Any Given Sunday.</p><p>His final acting credit came in 2014, starring as himself in the blockbuster movie Draft Day.</p><p>As mentioned by the Haslams and Goodell, Brown will also be fondly remembered for his work as a philanthropist and activist with the Black civil rights movement.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Brown was the founder of the Black Economic Union, aimed at guiding African American entrepreneurs, as per Cleveland's website.</p><p>He was also the founder of the Amer-I-Can organization, which aims to
